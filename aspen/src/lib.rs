//! # Aspen
//! A general-purpose, object-oriented,
//! purely immutable programming language.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! This project contains the full compiler â€“ the parser,
//! analyzer, optimizer, and emitter.
//!
//! It can be used directly as a Rust library, but is
//! mainly written to support the `aspen-cli` project,
//! which implements the CLI used for developing software
//! in Aspen.
